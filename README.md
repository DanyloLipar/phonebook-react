# phone-book-react-app

# Used technologies
React/TS/SASS(SCSS)/BEM
# Description
Phonebook app where you can add contacts, remove them, sort, search needed person. Besides you can see the detailes of every contact and edit this details.(Phone number, name etc.) In this project I used TypeScript, React with React Hooks and React router. Undoubtedly I used SCSS and BEM for better understanding of code and for creating it's simplicity.
